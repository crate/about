# CrateDB Blog | Leveraging Shared Nothing Architecture and Multi-Model Databases for Scalable Real-Time Analytics

_Real-Time Unified Data Layers: A New Era for Scalable Analytics, Search, and AI._

Modern data ecosystems are often fragmented, with scattered data sources, storage systems, and pipelines designed to meet specific business needs. When organizations demand advanced analytics, real-time applications, or machine learning models, these siloed systems struggle to scale and integrate effectively. Combining a Shared Nothing Architecture with a multi-model approach provides an innovative solution to these challenges, enabling scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility across distributed environments.

Understanding Shared Nothing Architecture in Distributed Databases
------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributed databases store and process data across multiple nodes that work as a unified system. In a Shared Nothing Architecture, each node operates independently with its own CPU, memory, and storage. This design eliminates shared resource bottlenecks and offers several advantages:

*   **Horizontal scalability**: Nodes can be added or removed dynamically, allowing the system to handle increasing data volumes and workloads without disrupting performance.
*   **Fault tolerance**: If a node fails, the system remains operational with no downtime as other nodes compensate, ensuring high availability.
*   **Performance optimization**: By avoiding shared resources, Shared Nothing Architecture minimizes latency and ensures consistent throughput for tasks like analytics and transactional queries.

Shared Nothing Architecture is especially effective for use cases that require stream processing and high reliability, such as real-time analytics and advanced search.

The Multi-model Database Approach
---------------------------------

Data in modern organizations exists in diverse formats, including relational tables, JSON documents, key-value pairs, and time-series data. Traditional databases are often limited to a single data model, forcing organizations to use multiple systems to manage these formats, leading to complexity and data silos.

Multi-model databases address this challenge by supporting multiple data models within a single system. Their benefits include:

*   Unified data management: A single platform can handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, reducing the need for multiple databases.
*   Flexible querying: Multi-model databases often use familiar query languages like SQL, simplifying data access and reducing the need for specialized skills.
*   Cost and operational efficiency: Consolidating workloads into one system minimizes infrastructure costs and simplifies management.
*   Adaptability to evolving use cases: Multi-model databases are versatile, making them ideal for applications like analytics, IoT, machine learning, generative AI, and agentic AI systems.

Combining Shared Nothing Architecture and Multi-model Databases
---------------------------------------------------------------

While Shared Nothing Architecture ensures scalability and fault tolerance, multi-model databases provide the flexibility to integrate and query diverse data. Together, they form a robust solution for modern data challenges. Changing existing systems is not always the right solution, it is more efficient to implement a sidecar approach, where the database integrates with the different data sources. This approach provides the scalability and flexibility needed to perform projects quickly without going through major infrastructure overhauls.

CrateDB: A Practical Example
----------------------------

CrateDB, a modern database for real-time analytics and hybrid search, showcases the advantages of combining [Shared Nothing Architecture](https://cratedb.com/product/features/shared-nothing-architecture) with a [multi-model](https://cratedb.com/resources/white-papers/lp-wp-multi-model-data-management) approach. Built on Shared Nothing Architecture principles, CrateDB delivers distributed scalability and supports diverse data types, making it a practical choice for modern data needs.

*   **Native SQL for flexible querying**: CrateDB allows users to query relational, document, time-series, geospatial, full-text, and vector data using SQL, eliminating the need for multiple query languages or manual transformations.
*   **Horizontal scalability**: CrateDBâ€™s Shared Nothing Architecture design distributes workloads dynamically, ensuring high performance even as data volumes grow.
*   **Schema flexibility**: CrateDB supports schema evolution, enabling organizations to integrate new data sources and adapt to evolving requirements without disruption.
*   **Seamless integration**: CrateDB offers unified access to diverse data sources, eliminating silos and improving data governance.
*   **Cost efficiency**: CrateDB is very easy to operate and has a very low footprint compared to other solutions, offering a lower TCO and having a positive impact on environmental efforts.
*   **Multi-cloud and hybrid support**: Offered as a service, CrateDB ensures a consistent experience across different cloud providers (AWS, Azure, and GCP). It can also be deployed on-premises to support hybrid scenarios.
*   **Suited for modern use cases**: CrateDB can ingest complex and large data streams, index all fields instantly, and perform complex aggregations, ad-hoc queries, and search in real-time.

Conclusion
----------

Combining Shared Nothing Architecture with a multi-model approach offers a powerful solution for managing distributed data environments. By integrating CrateDB as a sidecar database, organizations can modernize their data architectures for real-time analytics and hybrid search, while avoiding significant disruptions and minimizing costs. This strategy delivers scalable, flexible, and cost-effective data management, empowering businesses to optimize their data ecosystems and thrive in a data-driven world.
